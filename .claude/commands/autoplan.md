description: Run office-hours + plan automatically, stopping only for "taste" decisions (single approval gate)
---

**autoplan** for feature: **$ARGUMENTS** — run the planning sequence with minimal interruptions (borrowed from gstack /autoplan).

Auto-decide vs escalate principles:
- **Auto-decide** (decide without asking, document the choice): anything reversible, covered by a principle in CLAUDE.md / learnings.md, or a sensible stack default (e.g. use Supabase Realtime, strict TS, RLS keyed to auth.uid).
- **Escalate** (ask the user): one-way / hard-to-reverse decisions, core UX trade-offs, real product choices (e.g. auth method, data visibility rules, primary schema shape).

Process:
1. **office-hours (condensed)**: self-answer questions that have clear defaults; collect "taste" questions together.
2. **plan** (via `architect` subagent): build architecture + data flow + edge cases + **test plan** + DB changes.
3. **SINGLE APPROVAL GATE**: present to user — (a) decisions already made automatically (for awareness), (b) ONLY the taste questions that need a real decision (one batched AskUserQuestion).
4. After user answers → write full STATE (scope + plan + test plan), ready for `/build`.

Goal: the user answers exactly once for decisions that genuinely need them, instead of being interrupted at every step.
